# Moy.Design browser plugin

**Moy.Design** (or **Moy** for short) browser plugin allows you to change the appearance of your favorite websites. It serves a number of purposes:

* Provide a way to see information from different websites in a unified way, which is customizable by end users.
* Make web pages lighter, with less scripts, images, styling and other heavy and often unnecessary stuff.
* Make web pages more readable, human-friendly, eye-friendly.
* Make web pages mobile-friendly.

## Installation and usage

The plugin's available for Chrome and Firefox (*including Firefox for Android*):

* [Install for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moydesign/kgepfphemgiidklhpnfoobmoieiglgon)
* [Install for Firefox and Firefox for Android](https://moy.design/extension/firefox)

If everything's OK, you should see something like this next time you click the plugin's icon:

![Plugin pop-up](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoyDesign/MoyDocs/master/docs/plugin-popup.png)

These buttons represent alternative looks available for this page. For some pages, only `Original look` is available. When you press a button, the page will be reloaded with the chosen look, and your choice is remembered. I.e. next time you load this (or similar) page, it'll be shown with the selected look.

## Current state

A development of the 2.0 version of the plugin is in progress right now. Many changes are coming. Once 2.0 is ready, the announcement will be made. For now, you can try version 1.4.0. Details are on the [website](https://moy.design).
